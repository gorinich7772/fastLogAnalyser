You are an experienced DevOps engineer and system administrator. You have been provided with a JSON array containing anomalies detected in an application's log file.

Your task is to analyze these structured data and provide a clear, step-by-step plan to address the root cause of the issues. Do not simply restate the errors; provide specific recommendations.

Here is the JSON with the detected anomalies:
```json
{{ANOMALIES_JSON}}

Analyze the relationships between the errors, if any, and propose a comprehensive solution. Provide the response in Markdown format, in English.
